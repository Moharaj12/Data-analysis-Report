    "The value of vehicles spiked by 25% due to the recent pandemic.The demand for transportation is rapidly increasing as the population is increasing as well.The reason why we chose this data set is to determine which car is worth purchasing. As young adults we are beginning to buy our own first cars.This dataset shows us which vehicles depreciate less in value.\n",

A dataset called Software Engineering degree salaries was interesting as it related to our program.Another interesting data was the dataset on diamonds,that topic was interesting as it had many opportunities for data mini and visualisation.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Which car brand depreciates the least in value?\n",
    "2. How does Horsepower relate to the  fuel effiecieny?\n",
    "3. Do certain attributes have a bigger impact on holding value ?\n",
    "4. Do more expensive vehicles depreciate more ?\n",
    "5.  Which car models have been the most valuable?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What methods do you expect to apply when you process the data to answer these questions?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Have side by side comparison of each data\n",
    "- Creating a scatter plot and using LinearRegresion\n",
    "- Plot the attributes using a scatter plot to study the relationship using matplotlib \n",
    "- Creating Count plots to categorize our data\n",
    "### Do you see any potential for data science applications using this data?Examples: models for prediction, recommendation, data visualization, etc\n",

    "Buyers can use this dataset as a guidebook for making purchases on cars.\n",
    "Car Dealerships also can use this dataset as a guideline to increase their price of the car depending on the market.This data could also be converted to a machine learning model for the prediction of the price inflation because of aspect of the vehicle.Thus, an dealership could get an approximate value of their car models based on trends.\n",
    "This example will also help with predictions on the market value of vehicles.\n",
